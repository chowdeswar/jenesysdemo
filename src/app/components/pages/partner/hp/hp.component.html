                                <p>These tools are designed to make sure your applications function efficiently and
                                    perform to business requirements in production. However these have to be tested
                                    before deployment. Also along with manual testing, for maximum reuse and efficiency,
                                    certain essential components should be automated. The test execution solutions from
                                    HP enable you to detect and fix application issues before going live, therefore
                                    eliminating any possibility of inefficiency so that you can deploy with confidence.
                                    Testing execution tests the application GUI layer as well as underlying components
                                    for end-to-end coverage, along with performance testing, to ensure excellent quality
                                    in production.
