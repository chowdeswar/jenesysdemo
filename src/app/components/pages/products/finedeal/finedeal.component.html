                                    trend of performance of the portfolio as a whole. The FINdeal Information Management
                                    System provides your share brokers with up-to-date information - nationally,
                                    regionally, by client, and by industry - to help them close the deal. They can view
                                    at one place all the deals they have made with a client, trend these transactions to
                                    the larger picture of portfolio performance as a whole, evaluate exposure risk in
                                    their deals, and clearly see profit potential. With such quality information readily
                                    available, dealmakers can communicate a high level of knowledge and expertise that
                                    will make their suggestions and proposals valuable to any prospect and any company.
